WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-1) PREG Output pipelining - DSP design_1_i/nnip_0/inst/retrrt/M_error_hid0[2]1 output design_1_i/nnip_0/inst/retrrt/M_error_hid0[2]1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.
